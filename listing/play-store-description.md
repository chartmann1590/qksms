## 🌟 Key Features

### 💬 SMS & MMS Essentials
Send and receive text, pictures, videos, and group conversations with full message threading.

### 🤖 AI Smart Replies & Auto-Reply
Get AI-generated reply suggestions while typing, and enable automatic responses when you're busy — powered by your own local Ollama server (your messages stay on your network).

### 🌐 Web Sync (In Development)
Access your messages from any web browser by self-hosting the TextPilot web interface. View, send, and manage messages from your computer while keeping all data on your own server. Perfect for users who want desktop access without cloud services.
